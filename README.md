## OpenFDA - What's in my Pill?

Bit of a sequel (or should I say a SQL?) to an [earlier project](https://github.com/julia-yang/python_drug_db) in Python

## How to Run
From the openfda folder:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
